        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>This website is all about, you guessed it, it's been said 3 times already, anticonsumer news!<br> <strong>(wow!)</strong> </p>
        <p>While in reality a lot of the time these actions taken by companies do not affect you personally, it's important to stand for what you think is right, so they don't overstep their boundaries. Of course, as big, large, companies, they are probably not going to listen unless pushed by a big force. Vote with your wallet, this is capitalism!</p>
        <p>Even when voting with your wallet, though, it's likely that won't even work, so be vocal!</p>
        <p>Here are some of the reasons I think that <i>you</i> should care about these issues.</p>
        <h2>Reasons you should care</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Hurts your rights and freedom</li>
                <li>Hurts usability</li>
                <li>You will have less money</li>
                <li>You will have less control</li>
                <li>Can hurt shareholders too (oh no!) </li>
            </ol>
