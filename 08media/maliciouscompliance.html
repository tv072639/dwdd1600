    <h1>Apple's Malicious Compliance</h1>
    <p>With the recent passing of the digital markets act in the EU, Apple has decided to take a hostile, angry approach.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    For a while now, Google, and it's product Android have been open to outside sources for content since the start. You've always been able to sideload apps, and change your phone the way you want. <em>terms and conditions apply, of course</em>
    <br></p>

    <p>This is in contrast to Apple, which has always had a strong grip on their own platforms. If you want to sideload an app on one of their products, you better hope you have a Mac, <em>terms and condition still apply</em> or that you only want a very select few apps that you can sideload with something like <a href="https://altstore.io/" target="_blank">Altstore.</a></p>
    <br>
    <p>A lot of the controversy started when in 2021, Apple had decided to ban Fortnite from it's app store, for not complying with the App Store's terms of service. Fortnite had used an external payment processor inside of it's app instead of Apple's built in one. Finally, after a couple of years, Europe had taken notice.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, Apple needs to allow third party app stores, cloud streaming services, and payment processors. But, of course, they couldn't just let the companies let their apps on the iPhone without <em>some kind of monetization,</em> could they?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, there are fees associated with distributing apps outside of the app store. They are listed as follows, note that this only applies in the European Union.</p>

    <table class="AppleFees">
        <tr>
            <th>Product</th><th>Fee</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Normal in app transactions</td><td>17%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Special Discount in app transactions</td><td>10% - 17%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install fee before 1 million installs or updates</td><td>0$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install fee after 1 million installs or updates</td><td>0.50$</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Install fee for app stores</td><td>0.50$ per install or update</td>
        </tr>

    </table>
    </p>
