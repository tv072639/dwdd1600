<h1>Samsung and Motorola blocking phones in Mexico for no reason</h1>

<h2>Blocked</h2>
<p>Imagine waking up and turning on your new phone to realize that it's going to be remotely disabled. You can't access your data, you can't access your apps, you can't even make phone calls Unfourtanetly, to many, this was the unfortunate reality. On October 11th, Samsung started to block grey market phones. Motorola, was doing the same, blocking phones, giving an alert before they were locked. The first alert was on the day of activation. The second alert was 10 days after the activation, and the phone would be locked 11 days after activation, only allowing emergency calls.</p>
<h2>The excuse?</h2>
<p>This only applied to phones that were purchased through the grey market. The issue is that technology is generally more expensive in Mexico. Used phones can still be high in price, even if old. And, for an average consumer who might've just bought their phone from a sketchy store, how is this their fault? 1 out of 5 phones bought in Mexico are obtained via the grey market. The phones are barely, if at all different between countries, too, so why is this not happening anywhere else? Samsung and Motorola are the 2 leading android phone manufacturers in Mexico, so this had the potential to affect millions of people.<br>Now, to the excuse. Samsung and Motorola had used the excuse of "Safety and compliance with local regulations" to justify their unethical move. They didn't exactly specify what regulations, but, who cares? </p>
<h2>Oh so convienent</h2>
<p>If this happened, to you, though, you were in luck! Both Motorola and Samsung were giving out 30% discounts for products on their official store. To be honest, they're probably right. "Throw out your completely functioning phone that we decided to block because we <s>want more money</s> found that it conflicted with your safety and local regulations and buy a new one officially that is COMPLETELY different from the one you have now! It's not like we can dynamically adjust for what region you're in!"</p>
<h2>Mexico stopped this action.</h2>
<p>Thankfully, as an end to this, the government stepped in on October 19, 2023. Of course they did, because buying a grey market phone from Mexico is legal. <i>Your phone won't crash a plane just because it is in a different country.</i> Mexico called to form a group against the grey market, without hurting the consumer. They way it should have been, from the start.  </p>
